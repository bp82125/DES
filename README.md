# DES Implementation in Pure Python

This repository contains a pure Python implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) without relying on any external libraries. DES is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data, widely used in various applications.

## Overview

The DES algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks of plaintext and uses a 56-bit key for encryption and decryption. This implementation follows the standard DES encryption and decryption processes.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt plaintext using DES algorithm.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt ciphertext using DES algorithm.
- **Key Generation**: Generate random DES keys or provide custom keys for encryption and decryption.
